# The Overlook Hotel


## Abstract

This project is a reservation management system for a hotel. Customers are able to view reserved rooms and history. They can also search for new dates and make bookings. Managers are able to search through all users. They can also create and delete bookings.

I tried to use SOLID OOP principles with inheritance and it backfired on me. I over-thought the classes and it ended up making the program much more complicated. I hope to address it in the future. Testing became difficult with the high-level of integration of jQuery (which is something I will avoid at all costs in the future.)
